Paragraph vs continuous: 16% difference, font size difference: 8%:
    639 pages paragraph per verse
    551 pages continuous

Checklist: DONE :
    🗸 Margins
    🗸 Extra paragraph break at Matthew 1:2
    🗸 Proper alignment of mismatched verse numbers (use list of precise alignments)
    🗸 Page numbers
    🗸 Switch to upper-case KJV
    🗸 Verse 2 must not interfere with lettrine
    🗸 Verse 1 must not be shown
    🗸 Special verses highlighted
    🗸 Special verse highlighting: bold+italics in John 1:12 "even"
    🗸 Justify right margin (maybe review)
    🗸 Column spacing and line between
    🗸 Overfull hboxes!
    🗸 Gray the chapter numbers like the headings like
    🗸 Enable English and Afrikaans hyphenation
    🗸 Afrikaans accents for book titles
    🗸 1 Timothy weird page break! (was double needspace)
    🗸 Blank line appears before page wrap when a paragraph begins at the bottom of a page
    🗸 Chapter first line indentation (is too stretchy) (use hskip, not space)
    🗸 Chapter verse 2 next to DropCaps should NOT indent, but after lettrine, it SHOULD indent (work-around would be to stretchy verse 1 too)
    🗸 Drop Psalms and Proverbs
    🗸 Page print checker - right margin dot that draws a cross in the margin
Checklist: REVIEW :
    Check English and Afrikaans hyphenation
    Check font for all Afrikaans accents for spacing, kerning, etc:  !-—’”„ ok: ËÉáäéêëíïóòôúüý OT only: ēōÓÚŌ; high, but no collisions: ÁÍ; high, can lowercase: Ê -- review kerning of accented letters
    Intra-word space to make things better (l i k e   t h i s ...) ... try using other font .. did luatex+microtype, not  https://unifraktur.sourceforge.net/letterspacing.html#letterspacing_support-note_xelatex says \usepackage{fontspec,xspace} and then define a custom \em command like \renewcommand\emshape{\xspace\addfontfeature{LetterSpace=20.0,WordSpace=1.5,Ligatures={NoCommon}}} ..
    Check for chapters and booknames orphaned at the end of the page (needspace adjustment for book and chapter)
Checklist: TODO :
    🗸 Page headings - paracol breaks this, so log the references and page numbers to aux file, and make a csv with the heading for each page from that
    𐄂 Page headings - if justified, then right justify the margin too - no space like for ragged right
    🗸 Page headings should be CAPITALISED
    🗸 Page headings should be BOLD
    🗸 Book thumbnails - left margin shows book position (might be wrong too!)
